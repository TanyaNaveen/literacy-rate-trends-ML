# An Analysis of Literacy Rate Trends in India
Data Science &amp; Analytics Project - state finalist at the 2022 Technology Student Association state conference.

Despite being a global leader in innovation and technology, India is often still regarded as a third-world nation or a developing country. Indiaâ€™s overall literacy rate is actually only about 75% whereas its economic competitors such as the US, UK, South Korea, and China have overall literacy rates of 88%, 99%, 98%, and 96%, respectively. Furthermore, the male-female literacy difference in India is 19% on average, and higher in several states, while the US, UK, South Korea, and China have male-female literacy gaps of 12%, 1%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. 

This study investigates the relationships between various socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, internet access, GDP, crime, sex ratio, etc. and literacy rates in states and districts of India. Furthermore, this study aims to establish a ranking of importance of these relationships. 

This study utilizes Python libraries to (1) create 2D single linear regression and 3D multiple linear regression data visualizations, (2) conduct statistical analyses in order to quantify the degree of various relationships, and (3) train machine learning models for feature importance. 

Our results indicate that percent of urban population, percent of government vs private schools, income, per capita net state GDP, poverty, and access to technology are the factors that are most correlated with literacy rates to some degree, and together account for over half of the variance in Indian literacy rates across different states and districts in India.

Recognizing these factors paves the way for future research into causation, and provides an avenue for more data collection with respect to these factors in order to more effectively target and increase literacy rates.
